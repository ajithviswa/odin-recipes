        <h2>What Is a German Pancake?</h2>
        <p2>A German pancake (a.k.a. a Dutch baby) is similar to a large Yorkshire pudding. Unlike other types of pancakes, German pancakes are baked in the oven instead of fried on the stove.
            They also don’t contain leaving ingredients, such as baking powder or baking soda.</p2>
